Exam #7 - VPC

============
20) Exam Tips
============

A) VPC Fundamentals
=================
=> Think VPC as Virtual Data Center in the Cloud 
=> VPC Consists of
	Subnets
	Route Tables
	Internet Gateways
	NAT Gateways
	Igress Internet Gateways
	Security Groups
	Network ACLs

=> 1 Subnet is always in 1 AZ
=> 1 AZ contains multiple Subnets

B) Route Tables
================
=> Route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.

a) Main route table:
----------------------------
=> Route table that automatically comes with your VPC. 
=> It controls the routing for all subnets that are not explicitly associated with any other route table.

b) Custom route table:
----------------------------
=>Route table that you create for your VPC.
=> You can associate the Subnets to Your Route Table

c) Destination:
-------------------
=> Range of IP addresses where you want traffic to go (destination CIDR). 
=> Ex: 
*** External corporate network with the CIDR 10.0.0.0/20
*** Any with the CIDR 0.0.0.0/0
*** Any with the CIDR ::/0

d) Target:
-----------
=> Gateway, network interface, or connection through which to send the destination traffic
=>Ex:  
*** Internet Gateway, 
*** NAT Gateway
*** Igress-Only Internet Gateway

e) Route table association:
-----------------------------------
=> Association between a route table and a subnet, internet gateway, or virtual private gateway.

f) Local route: 
-------------------
=> Default route for communication within the VPC.

C) Internet Gateways
=================
=> Allow EC2 Instances in VPC to Connect to the Internet
=> Internet Gateway Must be created separately
=> One VPC can only be attached to One Internet Gateway and vice versa

D) NAT Gateways
==============
NAT - Network Address Translation

=> NAT Gateways allows the Instances in the Private Subnet to connect to the Internet.
=> Provision the NAT Gateway in the Public Subet.
=> NAT Gateway should be in the Same AZ where the Public Subnet is there.
=> Can not used by the EC2 Instances in the Same Subnet( Only from Other Subnets).

=> Starts with 5 Gbps and scales currently upto 45 Gbps.
=> Not Associated with any Security Groups.
=> NAT Gateway uses Elastic IP ( Static IP)

=> NAT Gateway is Resilient within a Single AZ
=> You must Create multiple NAT Gateways in  multiple  AZs for Fault-Tolerance.

E) Security Groups
================
=> A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic. 

=> Inbound rules control the incoming traffic to your instance
=> Outbound rules control the outgoing traffic from your instance. 

Security Groups are Stateful:
----------------------------------------
=> If you send the Request to EC2 Instance, Response Traffic for that Request is allowed to Flow-Out regardless of Outbound Rules.

=> If you send the Request from EC2 Instance, Response Traffic for that Request is allowed to Flow-In regardless of Inbound Rules.

F) Network ACLs
===============
*** ACLs --- Access Control List

1) Default Network ACLs:
------------------------------------
=> Your VPC automatically comes with  Default Network ACL.
=> By Default, It allows all In-bound and Out-bound traffic.
=> By Default, All the Subnets in the VPC will be Associated with Default Network ACL

2) Custom Network ACLs:
------------------------------------
=> You can create Custom Network ACLs
=> By Default, each Custom Network ACL denies all In-bound and Out-bound traffic until you add rules.

3) Subnet Associations:
------------------------------------
=> Each Subnet in your VPC must be associated with Network ACL
=> If you dont associate the subnet with Network ACL explicitly, then that Subnet will be associated automatically with Default Network ACL.
=> You can associate One Network ACL with multiple Subnets; however One Subnet can be associated with Only One Network ACL at a time.

4) Block IP Addresses:
---------------------------------
=> You can block required IP Addresses using Network ACL , not with Security Group.

5) Numbered List of Rules:
-------------------------------------
=> Network ACL contains Numbered List of Rules that are Evaluated in Order starting with Lowest-Numbered Rule.

6) Allow or Deny Traffic:
----------------------------------
=>  Network ACLs have Separate  In-bound and Out-bound Rules 
=> Each Rule can either Allow or Deny Traffic.

7) Network ACLs are Stateless:
------------------------------------------
=> Response to allowed In-bound traffic subject to the rules for Out-bound traffic
=> Response to allowed out-bound traffic subject to the rules for In-bound traffic

Q) Diff between Security Groups and Network ACLs


G) VPC Endpoints
=================
=> VPC Endpoint allows you to connect Your VPC to AWS Services without leaving AWS Internal Network .
=> VPC Endpoints are powered by PrivateLink without requiring Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, VPN Connection or AWS Direct Connect Connection.


Types of  VPC Endpoints:
----------------------------------
=> There are two types of  VPC Endpoints
	1) Interface Endpoints
	2) Gateway Endpoints

1) Interface Endpoints:
--------------------------------
=>  Interface Endpoint is an Elastic Network Interface(ENI) with Private IP Address that Serves as an Entry point for the traffic handled to a supported services.
=> This supports a large number of AWS Services 

2) Gateway Endpoints:
--------------------------------
=> Similar to NAT Gateways
=> Gateway Endpoint is a Virtual Device you Provision
=> This supports Connect to S3 and DynamoDB currently.

 
H) VPC Peering
===========
=> VPC Peering allows to connect One VPC to another VPC via Direct Network Route using private IP Address.

=> Instances behave as they are on the Same Private Network

=> Multiple VPCs must not have Overlapping CIDRs

=> You can peer VPC with other VPC in the same AWS Account as well as with other VPC in the different AWS Account

=> You can peer between regions.

=> Peering is done in Star Configuration
	( 1 Control VPC peers with  4 other VPCs)
=> Transitive Peering is not supported with VPCs.


I) AWS PrivateLink(VPC Endpoint Services):
=================================
=> AWS PrivateLink allows to  expose Service VPC to tens, hendreds or thousands of Customer VPCs
=> PrivateLink is Most secure and Scalable
=> PrivateLink does not require VPC Peering , Route Tables, NAT Gateways , Internet Gateways etc.
=> You can expose Service VPC to your own account or other aws accounts.

=> You just need the following
*** You need Network LoadBalancer on the Service VPC
*** You need ENI on the Customer VPC

J) Site-to-Site VPN Connection
=========================
=> VPN connection refers to the connection between your VPC and your own Corporate Data Center.

=>  Site-to-Site VPN supports Internet Protocol security (IPsec) VPN connections.

VPN Connection - Encryption
---------------------------------------------
=> Uses Public Internet 
=> Data in Transit is Encrypted with IPsec-encrypted

AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection
--------------------------------------------
=> Needs Two things
1) Virtual Private Gateway(VGW) 	- on the AWS side 
2) Customer Gateway(CGW)  		- on the Customer side


K) Exploring VPN CloudHub
========================
=> If you have multiple sites and each site is having its own VPN Connection , then you can use AWS VPN CloudHub to connect these sites together.

=> Hub-and-Spoke model
=> Low Cost and easy to manage
=> It Operates on the public internet, but all the traffic between Customer gateway and AWS VPN CloudHub is encrypted.

=> Simplifies VPN Network Topology.


L) DirectConnect(DX) 
=================
=>  DirectConnect is used to establish Private Connectivity between AWS Cloud and Your Data Center.
=> You can reduce the Network Costs
=> Usefull for high-throughput workloads( lots of network traffic)
=> Provides stable and reliable secure Connection.

Types of DirectConnect(DX) Connections
--------------------------------------------------
=> There are Two Types of DirectConnect Connections
1) Dedicated Connection
2) Hosted Connection

M) Transit Gateway
================
=> AWS Transit Gateway connects VPCs and On-Premises Networks through Central Hub.
=> This simplifies your network topology and puts an end to complex Peering Relationships.

=> Works on Hub-and-Spoke(Star) Model
=> Works on Regional basis, But you can have it accross multiple regions.
=> You can use it accross multiple AWS Accounts using RAM ( Resource Access Manager)
=> Allows you to have Transitive Peering between thousands of VPCs and On-premises Data Centers.
=> Works with Direct Connect Gateway and VPN Connections
=> Supports IP Multicast ( Not supported by any other AWS Service).

N) Understanding IPv6 for VPC
==========================
=> IPv4 is designed to provide 4.3 Billion IP Addresses. ( This number will be exhausted soon)
=> IPv6 is successor of IPv4.
=> IPv6 is designed to provide 3.4 x 10 ^ 38 Unique IP Addresses. 
=> Every IPv6 Address is Public and Internet-Routable
=> No Private IP Range in  IPv6 Addresses

Format:
----------
X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X

=> X is Hexa-Decimal Digits tanging from 0000 to FFFF
=> IPv6 address consists of 8 groups/Segments (separated with colons) 

IPv6 and CIDR
----------------------
2345:425:2CA1:0000:0000:567:5673:23b5/64

IPv6 in VPC
----------------
=> IPv4 can not be disabled for your VPC and Subnets
=> You can enable IPv6 to Operate in dual-stack mode.

O) Egress-Only Internet Gateway
==========================
=> Egress-Only Internet Gateway is used for IPv6 only.
=> This is Similar to NAT Gateway
	NAT Gateway 		- IPv4
	Egress-Only Internet Gateway - IPv6
=> Allow EC2 Instances in the Private Subnet to Access the Internet.
=> You must update the Route Tables

P) VPC Flow Logs
===============
=> Flow Logs are used to Capture the Information about IP Traffic going into your interfaces.
=> 3 Types of Flow Logs
	a) VPC Flow Logs
	b) Subnet Flow Logs
	c) ENI Flow Logs
=> Helps to Monitor and troubleshoot connectivity issues
=> Flow Logs data can go to S3 or Cloud Watch Logs
