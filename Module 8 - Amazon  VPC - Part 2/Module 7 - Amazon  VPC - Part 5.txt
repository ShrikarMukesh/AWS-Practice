Exam #7 - VPC

================================
9) Exploring Security Groups and NACLs
================================
A) Security Groups
===============
=> A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic. 

=> Inbound rules control the incoming traffic to your instance
=> Outbound rules control the outgoing traffic from your instance. 

=> By Default, Everything is blocked.
=> Let Everything In with 0.0.0.0/0
=> In Order to communicate with EC2 via SSH or RDP or HTTP or Some other , You need to open up the correct ports.

Important Ports
============
22 	SSH	Login to Linux Instances
21	FTP	Upload Files
22	SFTP	Upload Files with SSH
80	HTTP	Access UnSecured Web Applications
443	HTTPS	Access Secured Web Applications
3389	RDP	Login to Windows Instances

Security Groups are Stateful:
----------------------------------------
=> If you send the Request to EC2 Instance, Response Traffic for that Request is allowed to Flow-Out regardless of Outbound Rules.

=> If you send the Request from EC2 Instance, Response Traffic for that Request is allowed to Flow-In regardless of Inbound Rules.



B) Network ACLs
===============
*** ACLs --- Access Control List
=>  Network ACL is First-Line of Defense.
=> Network ACL is an Optional Layer of Security  for your VPC That Acts as Firewall for Controlling traffic IN and OUT of one or more Subnets in the VPC.

=> You can setup the Network ACL with Rules similar to Security Groups in order to add another Layer of Security  for your VPC 

Key Points about  Network ACLs
---------------------------------------------
1) Default Network ACLs:
------------------------------------
=> Your VPC automatically comes with  Default Network ACL.
=> By Default, It allows all In-bound and Out-bound traffic.
=> By Default, All the Subnets in the VPC will be Associated with Default Network ACL

2) Custom Network ACLs:
------------------------------------
=> You can create Custom Network ACLs
=> By Default, each Custom Network ACL denies all In-bound and Out-bound traffic until you add rules.

3) Subnet Associations:
------------------------------------
=> Each Subnet in your VPC must be associated with Network ACL
=> If you dont associate the subnet with Network ACL explicitly, then that Subnet will be associated automatically with Default Network ACL.
=> You can associate One Network ACL with multiple Subnets; however One Subnet can be associated with Only One Network ACL at a time.

4) Block IP Addresses:
---------------------------------
=> You can block required IP Addresses using Network ACL , not with Security Group.

5) Numbered List of Rules:
-------------------------------------
=> Network ACL contains Numbered List of Rules that are Evaluated in Order starting with Lowest-Numbered Rule.

6) Allow or Deny Traffic:
----------------------------------
=>  Network ACLs have Separate  In-bound and Out-bound Rules 
=> Each Rule can either Allow or Deny Traffic.

7) Network ACLs are Stateless:
------------------------------------------
=> Response to allowed In-bound traffic subject to the rules for Out-bound traffic
=> Response to allowed out-bound traffic subject to the rules for In-bound traffic

Diff between Security Groups and Network ACLs
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1)  Security Groups for EC2 Instances where as  Network ACLs for Subnets in your VPC
2)  Security Group can be associated with One or More EC2 Instances where as Network ACLs are also can be associated with One or MoreSubnets in your VPC
3)  EC2 Instrance can be associated with One or More One Security Group where as Subnet in your VPC   can be associated with One Network ACL only.
4)  Security Groups are stateful where as  Network ACLs are Stateless
5) Security Groups are Required where as  Network ACLs are Optional
6) Use Network ACLs for Blocking Specific IPs , Not  Security Groups
 
Demo 10: Network ACLs 
--------------------------------
A) Install nginx Web server on EC2 Instance( named as jlc-web-server)

ssh ubuntu@3.139.72.253 -i myjlc-kp.pem

sudo -i
apt-get update
apt-get install nginx -y

systemctl start nginx
systemctl enable nginx
systemctl status nginx

B) Open the Browser and hit the following

http://3.139.72.253:80

You Will not access Web Server.

C) Update Security Group.(myjlc-web-sg)

D) Open the Browser and hit the following

http://3.139.72.253:80

You Will access Web Server.

E) Update index.html

cd /var/www/html
mv index.nginx-debian.html index.html
cat index.html
echo "<h1> Hello Guys, Welcome to JLC </h1>" > index.html

F) Open the Browser and hit the following

http://18.188.39.148:80

G) Goto VPC bashboard and do the following

1) Select Security => Network ACLs
2) You can see 2  Network ACLs
	*** One for Default VPC
	*** One for Our Custom VPC
3) See the In-bound and Out-bound Rules of Default Network ACLs
	*** Allows All In-bound and Out-bound Traffic
4) Create Network ACLs
5)  See the In-bound and Out-bound Rules of Custom Network ACLs
	*** Denies All In-bound and Out-bound Traffic
6) Edit the Subnet Associations
	** Associate Public subnet with Custom Network ACLs
7) Try to Access the Web Server ( Problem)
8) Add the In-bound Rules required
9) Try to Access the Web Server ( Problem)
10) Add the Out-bound Rules required
11) Try to Access the Web Server(OK)
