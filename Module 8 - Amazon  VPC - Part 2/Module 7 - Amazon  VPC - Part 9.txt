Exam #7 - VPC


==============================
15) Exploring AWS DirectConnect(DX)
============================== 
=>AWS DirectConnect is a Cloud Service Solution that makes it easy to establish dedicated Netwrok Connection from Your Premises to AWS Cloud.

=>Using AWS DirectConnect, You can establish Private Connectivity between AWS Cloud and Your Data Center.

=> Dedicated Connection must be setup between your DC and AWS Direct Connect Locations
( There are 115 Direct Connect Locations accross the globe)

=> You need to setup Virtual Private Gateway on your VPC.

=> Using AWS DirectConnect Connection , You can access AWS Services like S3,EC2 etc

Benefits of DirectConnect:
-----------------------------------
1) You can reduce the Network Costs
2) Increase the Bandwidth throughput.
3) Provides most consistent Network Connection than Internet-based Connection.

Types of DirectConnect(DX) Connections
--------------------------------------------------
=> There are Two Types of DirectConnect Connections
1) Dedicated Connection
2) Hosted Connection

1) Dedicated Connection:
-----------------------------------
=> 1Gbps , 10Gbps, 100 Gbps Capacity
=> A physical Ethernet fiber-optic cable Connection associated with single customer.
=> Customer can request a dedicated connection through AWS DirectConnect console or CLI or API

2) Hosted Connection:
--------------------------------
=> 50Mbps, 500Mbps, to 10Gbps Capacity 
=> Capacity can be added or removed on demand.
=> A physical Ethernet fiber-optic cable Connection that is provisioned by DirectConnect partners.
=> Customer can request Hosted Connection by contacting  DirectConnect partners.

Note: It takes around 1 month to establish the new Connection.

Direct Connection - Encryption
---------------------------------------------
=> Data in Transit is not Encrypted but is Private.
=> AWS Direct Connect + VPN 
	** provides an IPsec-encrypted private Connection.
	** Good for Extra Level of Security but more complex to setup.

Q) Diff Between VPN Connections and DirectConnect Connections?

==========================
16) Exploring Transit Gateway
==========================
=> AWS Transit Gateway connects VPCs and On-Premises Networks through Central Hub.
=> This simplifies your network and puts an end to complex Peering Relationships.
=> It acts as a Cloud Router - Each new Connection is made only once.

	*****   Diagram   *****

Imp Points:
----------------
=> Works on Hub-and-Spoke(Star) Model
=> Works on Regional basis, But you can have it accross multiple regions.
=> You can use it accross multiple AWS Accounts using RAM ( Resource Access Manager)
=> Allows you to have Transitive Peering between thousands of VPCs and On-premises Data Centers.
=> Works with Direct Connect Gateway and VPN Connections
=> Supports IP Multicast ( Not supported by any other AWS Service).

Transit Gateway: Site-to-Site VPN ECMP
------------------------------------------------------
=> ECMP - Equal-Cost Multi Path Routing
=> This Routing Strategy allows you to forward the packet over multiple best paths.

 Use Case:
------------
=> Create Multiple Site-to-Site VPN Connections to Increase the Bandwidth of your connection to AWS.
