====================
5) AWS Firewall Manager
===================

5.1) Firewall Manager - Introduction
--------------------------------------------------
=> Firewall Manager is a Security Management Service in one place.

=> Firewall Manager allows you to centrally  setup and manage firewall rules across mutiple AWS accounts and mutiple applications in your AWS Organizations

=> Using Firewall Manager, You can create the AWS WAF Rules for  CloudFront, API Gateway, Application Load Balancer etc.

=> You can also mitigate DDoS attacks using Shield Advanced for your CloudFront , API Gateway, Application Load Balancer etc.

=> Security Policy : common set of security rules
	* WAF Rules ( ALB, CloudFront, API Gateway)
	* Shield Advanced( ALB,CLB,NLB, CloudFront)
	* Security groups(EC2)
	* Network Firewall(VPC)
	* Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall. 

=> With Firewall Manager, You set up your protections just once and the service automatically applies them across your accounts and resources, even as you add new accounts and new resources.

=> To Use Firwall Manager, You accounts must be registered with AWS Organizations.

5.2) Benefits of Firewall Manager
--------------------------------------------
  a) Helps to protect resources across accounts
  b) Helps to protect all resources of a particular type, such as all CloudFront distributions
  c) Helps to protect all resources with specific tags
  d) Automatically adds protection to resources that are added to your account
  e) Allows you to subscribe all member accounts in an AWS Organizations to AWS Shield Advanced
  f) Allows you to apply security group rules to all member accounts
  g) Lets you use your own rules, or purchase managed rules from AWS Marketplace


WAF Vs Firewall Manager Vs Shiled
============================
=> WAF, Shield and Firewall Manager are used together for centalized protection.

=> Define your Web ACL Rules in WAF.
=> WAF alone is the right choice for Granular protection of your Resources.
=> If you want to use AWS WAF across AWS Accounts , Centralize WAF Configuration and Automate the protection of new Resources then use Firewall manager with WAF.

=> Shield Advanced adds the extra features on the top of WAF.
=> If you are prone to frequent DDoS attacks the consider purchasing Shield Advanced.
=> If you want deploy Shield Advanced across all of your AWS Accounts then use Firewall manager with Shield Advanced


What is AWS Organizations?
======================
=> AWS Organizations is an account management service that enables you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage. 

=> AWS Organizations includes account management and consolidated billing capabilities that enable you to better meet the budgetary, security, and compliance needs of your business. 

=> As an administrator of an organization, you can create accounts in your organization and invite existing accounts to join the organization.

====================
6) AWS Network Firwall
===================

6.1) Network Firwall - Introduction
--------------------------------------------------
=> Network Firwall is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy Physical Firewall Protection across your VPCs.

=>Network Firwall has a Physical Infrastructure in AWS Data center that is managed by AWS. So no need to worry about management overheads.

=>Network Firwall also provides Intrusion Prevention System(IPS) that gives you active traffic flow inspection.
=> IPS - Detect the malicious activity and find a way to prevent that.

=> AWS Network Firewall works with AWS Firwall Manager, So you can centrally manage Security Policies across existing and newly Created Accounts and VPCs.

=> Network Firewall includes Firwall rules Engine that gives you complete control over your network traffic.

6.2) Network Firwall - Use-Cases
--------------------------------------------------
a) Filter Internet Traffic:
-------------------------------
=> You can use methods like ACL Rules, Stateful Inspection,Protocal Dection and Intrusion Prevention to filter your internet traffic.

b) Filter Outbound Traffic
----------------------------------
=> You can use Network Firwall to provide domain name , IP address and content-based outbound traffic filtering
=> This will help you to stop possible data loss and block know malware communications

c) Inspect VPC-to-VPC Traffic
----------------------------------
=> You can automatically Inspect traffic moving from One VPC to another VPC as well as across multiple accounts.


===================
7) Amazon GuardDuty
===================

7.1) GuardDuty - Introduction
-----------------------------------------
=> GuardDuty is a Threat Detection Service that uses AI and ML to continuously monitor the malicious behavior.

a) Unusual API Calls
b) Calls from Known malicious IP addresses
c) Attempts to disable CloudTrail Logging***
d) Unauthorized Deployments
e) Compromised EC2 Instances
f) Unusual Internal Traffic
g) Port Scanning
h) Failed Logins
i) Potential EKS Cluster compromizes
etc

=> It takes 7-14 days to set baseline
=> You can see Findings in the GuardDuty console and CloudWatch events

=> Can Protect against Crypto Currency Attacks.*

=> 30-days Free trail available and will be charged later based on the following
	* Volume of CloudTrail Events
	* Volume of DNS Logs
	* Volume of VPC Flow Logs
	etc


7.2) GuardDuty - Features
-----------------------------------------
=> Centralize threat detection across multiple AWS Accounts.
=> Findings appear in the GuardDuty console and CloudWatch events
=> Automated Responses using CloudWatch events and Lambda
=> Can receies the feed from third-parties line ProofPoint and CrowdStrike
=> GuardDuty is a security monitoring service that analyzes and processes data sources, such as 
	CloudTrail logs, 
	EBS volume data, 
	Kubernetes audit logs, 
	VPC flow logs
	RDS login activity
	DNS Logs

=================
8) Amazon Congnito
=================

8.1) Introduction
--------------------------
=> Congnito provides Authentication , Authorization and User Management for your web apps and mobile apps in Single Service without writing the custom code.

=> Your application Users can sign-in directly with username and password they have created in your applications.
=> Your application Users can also sign-in through third-party (Facebook, Amazon,google,apple ).

8.2) Cognito Features
----------------------------
=> Amazon Cognito provides the following features

a) Sign-up and sign-in services for your apps.
b) A built-in, customizable web UI to sign in users.
c) Social sign-in with Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, 
d) Access for Guest Users
e) Security features such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), account takeover protection, and phone and email verification.
etc

8.3) Use-Cases:
----------------------
a) Authentication:
------------------------
=> Users can sign-in directly usin User Pool or through third-party Identity Provider  (Facebook, Amazon,google,apple).

b) Third-Party Authetication:
---------------------------------------
=> Users can authenticate using Identity Pools that require Identity Provider Token(IdP token)

c) Access Server-Side Resources:
-------------------------------------------
=> Signed-In User is given a token that allows the access to the resources that you specify.

d) Access AWS AppSync Resources:
----------------------------------------------
=> Users can be given access to AppSync(GraphQL API) Resources with the tokens received from User Pool or Identity Pool in Cognito.


8.4) Two Important components in Congnito
------------------------------------------------------------
=> There are two main components in Amazon Cognito 
a) User Pools 
b) Identity Pools. 

=> You can use identity pools and user pools separately or together.

a) User Pools:
------------------
=> User Pools are directories of users that provide sign-up and sign-in options for your app users. 

b) Identity pools:
-----------------------
=> Identity pools allows you to grant your users the access to other AWS services.

8.5) Cognito Flow:
------------------------
=> Cognito user pool and identity pool used together.

***  Diagram **.

Here the goal is to authenticate your user, and then grant your user access to another AWS service.

a) Your App User signs in through a user pool and receives user pool tokens after a successful authentication.

b) Your App exchanges the user pool tokens for AWS credentials through an identity pool.

c) Your App User can then use AWS credentials to access other AWS services such as S3 or DynamoDB.
