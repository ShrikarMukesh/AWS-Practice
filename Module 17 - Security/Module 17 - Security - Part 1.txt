1) AWS CloudTrail
================

1.1) CloudTrail Introduction
----------------------------------------
=> CloudTrail is an AWS service which provides governance, compliance and auditing for your AWS account. 
=> Actions taken by a User, Role, or an AWS service are recorded as events in CloudTrail.
=> Events include actions taken in the Console, CLI, SDKs and API Calls.

=> Think of CloudTrail as CCTV monitoring for your AWS Account.

=> CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS account by default.
=> When activity occurs in your AWS account, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event. 

=> You can store CloudTrail Logs/Events into S3 Bucket or CloudWatch Logs for longer retention period.

=> Event/Log record contains the following
	a) Metadata around API Calls
	b) Identify of the API Caller
	c) Time of API Call
	d) Source IP Address of API Caller
	e) Request Parameters
	f) Response Elements returned by the Service
	etc

=> You can create two types of trails for an AWS account:
   * Trail that applies to all regions
   * Trail that applies to one region

1.2) CloudTrail Events
------------------------------
=> There are 3 types of CloudTrail Events
a) Management Events
b) Data Events
c) Insights Events

a) Management Events
-----------------------------
=> Operations that are performed on Resources in your AWS Account
=> These are also known as control plane operations
    Ex:
           *  Configure IAM Role
           *  Configure SecurityGroup
           *  Configure Subnet
           *  Configure Network ACL
	etc

=> By Default, Trails are configured to log management events.
=> These Events can be of two types
         * Read Events ( that do not modify the resources)
         * Write Events ( that modify the resources)

b) Data Events
--------------------
=> These are also known as data plane operations.
=> By Default, Data Events are not logged
  Ex:
       => S3 Object-Level Activity
	* GetObject
	* DeleteObject
	* PutObject

       => AWS Lambda Function Execution Activity
	* Invoke API

       => Amazon DynamoDB object-level API activity on Tables
	* PutItem
	* DeleteItem	
	* UpdateItem

c) Insights Events
------------------------
=> Insights Events capture unusual activity that is detected in your account. 
=> If you Enable Insights Events then CloudTrail detects unusual activity.
   Ex:
     * Inaccurate Resource Provisoning
     * Hitting Service Limits
     * Gaps in the Periodic Maintainance activity

=> CloudTrail Insights analyzes normal management events and create the baseline.
=> And then continuously analyze Write Events to detect unusual activities.

1.3) CloudTrail Event - Retention
--------------------------------------------
=> Events are stored in CloudTrail for 90 Days and will be deleted after 90 days.
=> To keep the events for longer period, You can log them to S3 and Use Athena to analyze.

1.4) CloudTrail - Demo
-------------------------------
=> Refer the Video and Write down the steps

2) DDoS Overview
================

2.1) DDoS Introduction
--------------------------------
*** DDoS - Distributed Denial of Service.
=> DDoS attack attempts to make your website or application Unavailable to end-user.

=> DDoS attacks can be achieved by multiple mechanisams such as 
	SYN Floods, Reflection/Amplification Attacks, Flood of Http Requests etc

2.2) Layer-4 DDoS attacks
----------------------------------
=> Layer-4 DDoS attacks are offen referred as SYN Floods.
=> It works at the Transport Layer.(TCP)

=> To Establish a TCP Connection, 3-Way Handshake takes place.
	a) Client Sends SYN packet to Server
	b) Server Replies with SYN-ACK
	c) Client Responds to that with ACK.

=> After "3-Way Handshake" is complete, TCP Connection is established.

=> After TCP Connection is established, 
	* applications start sending data using Layer-7(Application Layer) Protocal such as Http etc

SYN Floods:
----------------

*** Diagram ***

=> SYN Flood uses the built-in patience of TCP Stack to drown the server by sending large number of SYN Packets and then Ignoring the SYN-ACKs returned to Server.

=> This causes the server to use up the resources waiting for a set amout of time for the aniticipated ACK that should come from legitimate client.

=> with this, there are so many concurrent TCP Connections open.

=> So If Attacker send more SYN packets to server , it can easily eat through the allowed number of connections.

=> This then prevents legimate user requests from being answered by the server.

2.3) Amplification attacks
----------------------------------

*** Diagram ***

=> Amplification/Reflection attacks can include things such as NTP, DNS, SNMP attcks.

=> Attacker send the Third-Party Server ( such as NTP server, DNS server etc) requests using spoofed IP Address.

=> Third-Party Server will respond to that request to the spoofed IP Adddress with greater payload than the initial request payload  

=> This means that if the attcker sends the packet with 64 bytes, Third-Party Server would respond with upto 3,456 bytes of traffic.

2.4) Layer-3 DDoS attacks
----------------------------------
=> Network volumetric attacks are also referred as the Layer-3 attacks 
=> This is a sub category of infrastructure layer attack vectors. 
=> These vectors attempt saturates the capacity of the targeted network or resource, to deny service to legitimate users.

2.5) Layer-7 DDoS attacks
----------------------------------
*** Botnet - Network of computers infected by malware that are under the control of a single attacking party, 

=> Layer-7 DDoS attack occurs when a Web server receives flood of Http Get or Post requests, usually from botnet or Large number of compromised computers
