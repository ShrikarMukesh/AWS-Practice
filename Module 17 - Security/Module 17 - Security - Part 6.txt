14) AWS Secrets Manager
====================

14.1) Introduction
------------------------
=> Secrets Manager is a service that securely Stores , Encrypts and Rotates your Database Credentials and other secrets.

=> Secrets Manager can store the following
	a) RDS Credentials
	b) Non-RDS Credentials
	c) Any other type of Secret which can be stored as Key-Value pair( SSH Keys, API Keys etc)

=> You can store Secrets as PlainText or Encrypted Data
=> It costs money but highly scalable.

=> Secrets Manager enables you to replace hardcoded credentials in your code, including passwords ,with an API call to Secrets Manager to retrieve the secret programmatically. 
=> This ensure that secret can't be compromised by someone examining your code
=>  Also, You can configure Secrets Manager to automatically rotate the secret for you according to a specified schedule.

14.2) Key Points:
---------------------
=> Encryption in flight and at rest using KMS
=> Automatically Rotates the Credentials
