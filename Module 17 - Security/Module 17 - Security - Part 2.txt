================

3.1) AWS Shield - Introduction
----------------------------------------
=> Protection against DDoS attacks is of primary importance for your internet-facing applications.

=> AWS Shield is a managed DDoS protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS.

=> AWS Shield protects against  Layer 3/Layer 4 attacks only

=> AWS Shield comes with two flavors
	a) Shield Standard
	b) Shield Advanced

3.2) Shield Standard:
-------------------------
=> This is Activated for every AWS Account and is Free for all the Accounts.

=> Provides the Protection for all the AWS Customers on EC2, ELB, CloudFront, Global Accelerator, Route 53.

=> Provides protection from attacks such as SYN/UDP Floods , Amplification/Reflection attacks and other Layer 3/Layer 4 attacks.

3.3) Shield Advanced
-------------------------
=> It is an Optional DDoS mitigation Service.
=> Charges are $3,000 per month per Organization.

=> Provides the Protection against more sophistificated attacks on EC2, ELB, CloudFront, Global Accelerator, Route 53.

=> Offers Always-On monitoring of network traffic and active application monitoring to provide near real-time notifications of DDoS attacks.

=> Gives 24/7 Access to AWS DDoS Response Team 
=> Protects against higher fees during usage spikes due to DDoS attacks.

=> Sheild Advanced has wonderful feature called - "Automatic Application Layer DDoS mitigation"
=> This feature automatically creates, evaluates and deploys AWS WAF Rules to mitigate Layer-7 Attacks.

4) AWS WAF
================

4.1) AWS WAF - Introduction
---------------------------------------
*** WAF - Web Application Firewall

=> WAF allows you to monitor the HTTP(S) requests that are forwarded to your web application resources. 

=> You can protect the following resource types:
	* CloudFront distribution
	* Application Load Balancer
	* API Gateway REST API
	* AppSync GraphQL API
	* Cognito user pool

=> WAF operates on Application Layer( Layer 7)
=> WAF Protects your web applications from common Layer-7 attacks.

=> WAF also allows you to control access to your content.
=> Define Web ACL Rules ( Web Access Control List)
=> Web ACLs are regional except CloudFront distributions.
=> You can configure the conditions like
	* What IP addresses are allowed to make request.
	* What Query string parameter need to be passed with reqest to be allowed.
	
=> Based on the conditions you specify, Your protected resource responds to requests either with the requested content, with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden), or with a custom response.

4.2) Behaviors
---------------------
=> At most basic level, WAF allows 3 different behaviors
a) Allow All Requests except the ones you specify
b) Block All Requests except the ones you specify
c) Count the Requests that match the properties you specify

4.3) Web Access Control List ( Web ACL)
-----------------------------------------------------
=> Web ACL gives you fine-grained control over all of the HTTP(S) web requests that your protected resource responds to. 
=> You can protect CloudFront, API Gateway, Application Load Balancer, AppSync, and Cognito resources.

=> You can use criteria like the following to allow or block requests:
a) IP address that request originate from
b) Country that request originate from
c) Values in the Request Headers
d) Query String Parameters
e) Presence of SQL Code that is likely to be malicious ( Knows as SQL Injection)
f) Presence of Script that is likely to be malicious ( Knows as Cross-Site Scripting)
g) Strings that appear in the request ( either specific strings or strings thatmatch regular exp patterns)
i) Size of a particular part of the request

=> You can also test for any combination of these conditions. 
=> You can block or count web requests that meet the specified conditions,
=> You can block or count web requests that exceed a specified number of requests in any 5-minute period. 
=> You can combine conditions using logical operators.
