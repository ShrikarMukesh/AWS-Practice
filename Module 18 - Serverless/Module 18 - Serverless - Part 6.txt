7.1) Introduction
------------------------
=> AWS Step Functions is a Serverless Service that allows you to orchestrate Lambda functions.

=> A Reliable way to step through the Functions allows runs your applications in a particular order.
=> Gives Visual workflows for distributed applications

=> Allows you to configure State Machines using Amazon State Language.
=> You can build State Machines using Step Functions
=> State machine contains States.
=> State machine is a workflow. 
=> Each step in a workflow is a state.
=> State in a workflow represents a single unit of work performed by another AWS service.
=> Each State takes the Input and Produces the output 

=> You can also create long-running, automated workflows for applications that require human interaction.

7.2) Use-Cases
----------------------
1) We can design the Workflows/State Machines using Step Fenctions
2) Long Running Business Processes that extend beyond the 15-minute life of a Lambda Function
3) Can Involve in Human Approval
4) Parallel execution of Lambda Functions
5) Error Handling
6) Retry-Logic

=> AWS Offers two types of Workflows
a) Standard workflow
b) Express workflow
