========================
14) CNAME Vs ALIAS Records
========================
=> AWS Resources like EC2, Load Balancers, S3 Buckets, CloudFront etc will expose AWS Host Names.
=> You can map this hostname with your domains using CNAME  and ALIAS 

a) CNAME Record
-------------------------
*** CNAME - Canonocal Name

=> CNAME can be used to map the domain name with another Hostname.
Ex:
	lms.myjlc123.com	=> Some LB-host-name

=> CNAME can not be used for Root Domains.
Ex:
	myjlc123.com	=> Some LB-host-name   // Not OK

=> CNAME can be used only for Non-Root Domains.
Ex:
	mycourses.myjlc123.com	=> Some LB-host-name //OK

b) ALIAS Record
-----------------------
=> ALIAS can be used to map the domain name with AWS Resources
=> ALIAS can be used for both Root Domains and Non-Root Domains.

Ex:
	myjlc123.com		=> Some LB-host-name   // OK
	mycourses.myjlc123.com	=> Some LB-host-name //OK

=> ALIAS Record is always type of A or AAAA for AWS Resources.
=> Automatically recoznizes the Changes in the Resource IP Addresses
=> You can not set TTL Seconds

Demo:
======
1) Create the S3 Bucket  - myjlc-web
2) make the Bucket Public
3) Enable Static Website Hosting

You will see the following hostname for the static website.
http://myjlc-web.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

4) Upload index.html
5) Change Permissions
6) Access the following URL

http://myjlc-web.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

7) Map the domain with S3 bucket hostname
Just Create CNAME Record as follows

i) Goto Route 53 Dashboard
ii) Click on Hosted zones (Left Menu)
iii) Select Your Domain( In my case - myjlc123.com) 
iv) Click on Create Record
v)  Provide the following details
a) Record name 	: 	courses.myjlc123.com  (Non-Root domain)
b) Record type 	: 	CNAME
c) Value 		: 	 http://myjlc-web.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
d) TTL (seconds) 	: 	60
e) Routing policy 	: 	Simple Routing


6) After providing Above Details, Click on  Create Record.
7) Wait for 60 Seconds (TTL) , try with nslookup

nslookup courses.myjlc123.com

8) Now You canAccess the Web Application from browser with domain myjlc123.com
http://myjlc123.com  
http://courses.myjlc123.com
