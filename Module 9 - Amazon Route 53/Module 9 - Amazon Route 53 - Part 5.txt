Exam #8 - Route 53

1) London - 
IP 		:	3.10.212.17
DNS / Hostname 	:	ec2-3-10-212-17.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

2) N.Virginia
IP		:	3.236.160.39
DNS / Hostname 	:	ec2-3-236-160-39.compute-1.amazonaws.com

3) Mumbai:
IP		:	43.205.127.94
DNS / Hostname 	:	ec2-43-205-127-94.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com


======================
11) Latency Routing Policy
======================
=> Allows you to route your traffic based on the lowest network latency for your end user.
(i.e, the region which will give the fastest response time)

Latency Resource Record Set:
-----------------------------------------
=> To use latency based routing,You need to create latency resource record set for the EC2 instances (or ELB) in each region that holds your website.
=> When route 53 receives query for your site, It selects the latency resource record set for the region which gives the lowest latency for the user.
=> Route 53 then responds with the value associated with that resource record set.

Demo: Using Latency Routing Policy
---------------------------------------------------
1) Goto Route 53 Dashboard
2) Click on Hosted zones (Left Menu)
3) Select Your Domain( In my case - myjlc123.com) 
4) Click on Create Record
5)  Provide the following details
a) Record name 	: 	myjlc123.com  (Root domain)
b) Record type 	: 	A 
c) Value 		: 	 mumbai-IP
d) TTL (seconds) 	: 	120
e) Routing policy 	: 	Latency
f) Region		: 	Mumbai
g) Health Check	: 	mumbai-HC
h) Health Record	: 	mumbai-Record

6) After providing Above Details, Click on  Create Record.
7) Wait for 120 Seconds (TTL) , try with nslookup

nslookup myjlc123.com

8) Now You canAccess the Web Application from browser with domain myjlc123.com
http://myjlc123.com

Note : Create 3 Records for 3 Regions

======================
12) Failover Routing Policy
======================
=> FailOver routing policies are used when you want to create an active\passive setup.

Ex:

=> You want your primary site to be in us-east-1 and secondary DR site in eu-west-2.
=> Route 53 will monitor the health of your primary site using a health check.
=> If Primary Healtk is Ok then Routes always to Primary 
=> If Primary Healtk is Not Ok then Only Routes always to Secondary

Demo: Using Failover Routing Policy
---------------------------------------------------
1) Goto Route 53 Dashboard
2) Click on Hosted zones (Left Menu)
3) Select Your Domain( In my case - myjlc123.com) 
4) Click on Create Record
5)  Provide the following details
a) Record name 	: 	myjlc123.com  (Root domain)
b) Record type 	: 	A 
c) Value 		: 	 N.Virginia-IP
d) TTL (seconds) 	: 	120
e) Routing policy 	: 	Failover 
f) Failover Record Type: 	Primary
g) Health Check	: 	Virginia-HC
h) Health Record	: 	Virginia-Record

6) After providing Above Details, Click on  Create Record.
7) Wait for 120 Seconds (TTL) , try with nslookup

nslookup myjlc123.com

8) Now You canAccess the Web Application from browser with domain myjlc123.com
http://myjlc123.com

Note : Create 2 Records for 2 Regions ( US - Primary and UK- Secondary)

===========================
13) Geo-Proximity Routing Policy
===========================

Route 53 Traffic Flow:
-------------------------------
=> You can use Route53 traffic flow to build your custom routing system that uses the combination of various Routing Policies like  Geographic location , Latency etc 
from your users to your cloud.

* You can build your own traffic routing policy from scratch
 or   you can pick template from library and then customize it.

Geo-Proximity Routing
--------------------------------
=> Geo-proximity routing lets Route53 to route trafic to your Resource based on geographic location of your users and geographic location of your Resources.

=>You can also optionally choose to route more or less traffic to a given Resource by specifying a value called bias.

=>Bias expands or shrinks the size of the geographic region from which traffic is routed to a Resource.

Demo: Using Route 53 Traffic Flow
---------------------------------------------------
1) Goto Route 53 Dashboard
2) Click on Traffic Policies under Traffic flow (Left Menu)
3) Click on Create Traffic Policy 
4)  Provide the following details
a) Policy Name : myjlc-traffic-system
b) Version  : 1
c) Version description :  myjlc-traffic-system
and Click Next
5) See the Video and Have the Idea
