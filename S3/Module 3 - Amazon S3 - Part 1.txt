Exam #3 - Simple Storage Service (S3) 

==================
A) Exploring Amazon S3 
==================
1) What is S3?
2) Working with S3 Buckets
3) Key-Value Store
4) Availability and Durability

1) What is S3?
=============
=> S3 - Simple Storage Service 
=> S3 is Global Service but Region Selection is Required while you Create Bucket
=> S3 is an Object Storage in Cloud
=> S3 Manages Data as Objects rather than files in File System.

=> S3 provides Highly Secure , Highly Durable , Highly Avaiable , Highly Scalable Object Storage.

=> S3 allows you to store and retreive any amount of data from anywhere on web at very low cost.
=> S3 is Easy to use with Simple Web Interface.

=> You can Upload any file types in S3.
Ex:
  Text Files
  Documents
  Images
  Videos
   etc

=> S3 can not be used to run Operating Systems or Databases.

Unlimited Storage:
-------------------------
=> Amount of Data you can store in S3 in Unlimited.
=> Number of Objects you can store in S3 in Unlimited.

Objects upto 5TB in size:
--------------------------------
=> Individual S3 object can range in size from a minimum of 0 bytes to a maximum of 5 TB. 
=> Largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT is 5 GB. 


2) Working with S3 Buckets
======================
=> S3 Stores the Files in Buckets ( Bucket is like a Folder)

=> Each S3 Bucket name is globally Unique.
=> All AWS accounts share the S3 Namespace.

Sample S3 Object URL's
----------------------------------
https://bucket-name.s3.region.amazonaws.com/key-name
https://myjlc-bucket1.s3.amazonaws.com/hello.html (Picks from Any AZ in ANy Region)
https://myjlc-bucket1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/hello.html (Specific Zone in One Region)
https://myjlc-bucket1.s3.amazonaws.com/test/hello.html

=> When the File upload to S3 is successful then you will receive HttpStatus code 200.( AWS CLI/SDK?AWS API)

=> You can upload any number of objects to the bucket.

=>  By default, You can create up to 100 buckets in each of your AWS accounts. 
=> If you need more buckets, you can increase your account bucket limit to a maximum of 1,000 buckets by submitting a service limit increase.

3) Key-Value Store
==============
=> Every File you are uploading will be stored in S3 as Object.
=> S3 Object has following Properties.

a) Key :
------------
=> Name of the Object is the Key.
 Ex: 
    hello.jpg
    index.html

b) Value :
------------
=> Data itself which is made up of sequence of bytes.

c) Version Id:
---------------
=> Objects wil be stored in Multiple versions

d) MetaData
----------------
=> Data about the Data you are storing
Ex:
    content-type
    last-modified
    content-size

4) Availability and Durability
========================
=> S3 is a Very Safe place to Store your files

=> Data in S3 is Spread accross Multiple Devices and Multiple Facilities to ensure Availability and Durability

=> S3 is Built for Highly Available

*** Built  for 99.95% to 99.99% Service Availability depends on S3 Tier.

=> S3 is Designed for Highly Durable

*** Designed for 99.999999999% Durability ( 11 9's)
