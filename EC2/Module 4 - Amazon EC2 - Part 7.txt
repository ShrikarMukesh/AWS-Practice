1) Introduction to EC2
=================
=> EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud.
=> EC2 is Secure and Re-Sizable Compute Capacity in the Cloud.
=> EC2 is a Virtual Server hosted in the Cloud****
=> Provides the Compute Capacity You want when You need.
=> EC2 = Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)

*Game Changer
----------------------
=> EC2 Launched in 2006 and Complete Game Changer.It Literally changed the Entire Industry.
=> AWS led a big Change in the Industry by Introducing EC2.

*Pay only for what you use.
---------------------------------------
=> EC2 changed the Econamics of Computing

*No Wasted Capacity
----------------------------
=> Select the Capacity you need right now.
=> Grow and Shrink when you need.

*Wait for Minutes , Not Months
--------------------------------------------
=> Need Minutes to Setup the Required Compute Capacity.


=====================
2) Launching EC2 Instances
=====================
A) About EC2:
===========
Q) Where will you deploy your application in the Cloud?
Ans: Virtual Servers in the Cloud / EC2 Instances

EC2 Instance => Virtual Servers in the Cloud

B)EC2 Service
===========
a) Manage the Lifecycle of EC2 Instances
Create , Start , Stop , Delete (Terminate)

b)Add the Storage Capabilities(EBS - Elastic Block Store)
c)Add the Network Capabilities(VPC - Virtual Private Cloud)
d) Load Balancing Capabilities(ELB - Elastic Loab Balancer)
e)Auto-Scaling Capabilities(ASG - Auto Scaling Group)
etc

C)EC2 Configuration
================
a) O.S => Linux, Windows, Mac
b) CPU => Cores Required 
c) RAM => RAM Required
d) Storage => EBS (HardDisk)
e) Network => VPC , Sub-Net Masks
f) Firewalls => Security Groups
g) Login Details => key-pair
h) BootStrap Scripts => User Data
etc

=====================
3) Amazon EC2 key pairs
=====================
*** All the Cloud Servers are Password less by deafult.***
*** Password Authetication is disabled by deafult.***

=> A Key-Pair, contains a Public key and a Private key
=> A Key-Pair,  is a set of security credentials that you use to prove your identity when connecting to an Amazon EC2 instance.
=> Amazon EC2 stores the public key on your instance
=> You store the private key.

===============
4) Security Groups
===============
=> A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic. 

=> Inbound rules control the incoming traffic to your instance
=> Outbound rules control the outgoing traffic from your instance. 

=> One EC2 Instance can have one or more Security Groups
=> One Security Group can be attached to Multiple EC2 Instances.

=====================
5) Connect to EC2 Instances
=====================

Connect to Linux Based EC2 Instances
---------------------------------------------
=> Use SSH to Connect to  Linux Based EC2 Instances
=> From Mac, Linux ,Windows>=10  	---> Use SSH, Putty
=> From Windows<10 		---> Use Putty
=> From Any OS 			---> Use EC2 Connect

Connect to Windows Based EC2 Instances
---------------------------------------------
=> From Any OS 			---> RDP/RDC

===============
6) Virtualization
===============
=> Virtualization is the foundation of cloud computing
=> When You Deploy your applications in Physical Servers or dedicating  physical server to a specific application , then there is an excess capacity that is not being consumed, which leads to higher operating costs and IT costs.

*What is Virtualization?
-------------------
=> Virtualization uses software (like Hyperviser) to create an abstraction layer over the physical hardware. 
=> It creates a virtual compute system, known as virtual machines (VMs). 
=> This allows you to run multiple virtual computers, operating systems, and applications on a single physical server â€” essentially partitioning it into multiple virtual servers. 

*Advantages
-------------------
A) Utilizing Resources Efficiently.
B) Reduce your  operating costs and IT costs.

==================
7) EC2 Instance Types
==================
A) General Purpose
B) Compute Optimized
C) Memory Optimized
D) Storage Optimized
E) Accelerated Computing

A) General Purpose
===================
=> General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory and networking resources, and can be used for a variety of diverse workloads.

B) Compute Optimized
===================
=> Compute Optimized instances are ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from high performance processors. 
=> These Instances are well suited for compute intensive applications.

C) Memory Optimized
===================
=> Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.

D) Storage Optimized
===================
=> Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage. 

E) Accelerated Computing
===================
=> Machine learning, high performance computing, computational fluid dynamics, computational finance, seismic analysis, speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, and drug discovery.

==================
8) AWS Command Line
==================
=> You can access AWS Resources in two Ways

1) Using Management Console
2) Using AWS CLI or SDK

1) Using Management Console
------------------------------------------
=>To Access AWS Resources from Management Console, You need Username and Password 

2) Using AWS CLI or SDK
--------------------------------------
To Access AWS Resources from CLI or  SDK, you need two things

1) Access Key ID
2) Secrect Access Key

==============
9) Using IAM Roles
===============
=> IAM Role is Similar to IAM User
=> IAM Role is an Identity with specific Permissions
=> IAM Role is intended to be used by anyone who needs it.

=> IAM Roles does not have any standard long-tem credentials like Password or Access Keys like User.
=> Instead, When you assume a Role, It Provides you the Temporary credentials for your Role-Session.

=> Roles can allow Cross-Account Access.
 This means One AWS Account has the ability to interact with Resources in other AWS Account.

==========================
10) BootStrap Scripts with UserData
==========================
=> Script that Runs when the EC2 Instance FIRST Starts

#!/bin/bash
/bin/echo "Hello Guys!!!" >> /home/ubuntu/hello.txt

=> Adding these tasks at Boottime increases the amount of time it takes to boot the Instance.
=> However, It allows to automate the Installations of Required Softwares and Applications.

=============
11) EC2 MetaData 
=============
=> EC2 MetaData is simply Data about your EC2 Instance.
=>  EC2 MetaData includes information such as
Private IP
Public IP
hostname
Security Groups
etc

=> You can fetch the EC2 MetaData  as follows
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data

====================
12) EC2 Pricing Options
=====================
1) On-Demand Instances
2) Reserved Instances
3) Spot Instances
4) Decicated Instances

1) On-Demand Instances
===================
=> Pay for the Hour or Second you use.
=> Low Cost and Flexible without any upfront payments or Long-term commitments

Use Cases
========
=> Suitable for Applications Short-term or Unpredictable workloads
=> Suitable for Applications being developed or tested on EC2 for the first time.

2) Reserved Instances
===================
=> You can purchase a Reserved Instance for a one-year or three-year commitment.
=> Reserved Instances do not renew automatically; when they expire.
=> You can continue using the EC2 instance without interruption, but you are charged On-Demand rates. 

Use-cases:
========
=> Suitable for Applications with Steady State or Predictable workloads


3) Spot Instances
===================
=> Purchase the Unused Capacity at discount upto 90% comapred to On-Demand Instances.

Spot Price
=========
=> The hourly price for a Spot Instance is called a Spot price. 

Spot Blocks
=========
=> You can use the Spot Block to stop your Instances being terminated  If the Spot Price goes above your max Spot Price.
=> You can set the BlockDuration between 1 to 6 hours currently.

Spot Fleet:
========
=> Spot Fleet is Collection of Spot Instances and (Optionally) On-Demand Instances
=> Spot Fleet attempts to launch the number of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances to meet the Target Capacity Specified in the Spot Fleet Request.

Launch Pools:
==========
=> Spot Fleet will try and match the Target Capacity with your Price.
=> Spot Fleet setup diffetent Launch Pools
=> Spot Fleet will choose best way to implement depending on the Allocation Strategy you specified.

Allocation strategies:
----------------------------

4) Decicated Instances
===================
=> Dedicated Instances are physical Servers  that are dedicated to a single customer. 

=> Decicated Instances can be Purchased On-Demand( Hourly basis)
=> Decicated Instances can be Purchased as Reservation for upto 70% off on the On-Demand Instances.

Use Cases:
========
=> Regulatory Requirements that may not support Multi-Tenant Virtualization
=> Great for Licensing that does not support Multi-Tenant Virtualization

=====================
EC2 Placement Groups
=====================
=> 3 Types of Placement Groups

A) Cluster Placement Group
B) Partition  Placement Group
C) Spread Placement Group

A) Cluster Placement Group
----------------------------------------
=> Instances will be Launched within a single Availability Zone.
=> Low Network Latency, High Network Throughput, or both. 
=> Only Certain Instance Types can be Launched into Cluster Placement Group

B) Partition  Placement Group 
------------------------------------------
=> Helps to  reduce the hardware failures for your application.
=> Instances will be Launched  in multiple Availability Zones in the same Region. 

C) Spread Placement Group
--------------------------------------
=> Helps to  reduce the risk of simultaneous failures that might occur when instances share the same racks. 
=>Instances will be Launched  on distinct racks, with each rack having its own network and power source.
=> Can span multiple Availability Zones in the same Region. 

For All Placement Groups:
-----------------------------------
=> You can not merge the Placements groups
=> You can move an existing Instance into a Placement Group.Before You move the Instance, You must stop the Instance.
=> You can move or remove an Instance using AWS CLI or SDK. But can not do it via Console currently.
