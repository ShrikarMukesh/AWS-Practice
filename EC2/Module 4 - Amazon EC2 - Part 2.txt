Exam #4 - Amazon EC2

===============
4) Security Groups
===============
=> A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic. 

=> Inbound rules control the incoming traffic to your instance
=> Outbound rules control the outgoing traffic from your instance. 

=> One EC2 Instance can have one or more Security Groups
=> One Security Group can be attached to Multiple EC2 Instances.

=> If you don't specify a Security Group, Amazon EC2 uses the default Security Group. 
=> Security Groups are limit to Region or VPC

=> You can add rules to each security group that allow traffic to or from its associated instances. 
=> You can modify the rules for a security group at any time.
=>  New and modified rules are automatically applied to all instances that are associated with the security group. 

=> Security Group Contains Rules + Security Group.

Important Ports
============
22 	SSH	Login to Linux Instances
21	FTP	Upload Files
22	SFTP	Upload Files with SSH
80	HTTP	Access UnSecured Web Applications
443	HTTPS	Access Secured Web Applications
3389	RDP	Login to Windows Instances

=====================
5) Connect to EC2 Instances
=====================

Connect to Linux Based EC2 Instances
---------------------------------------------
=> Use SSH to Connect to  Linux Based EC2 Instances
=> From Mac, Linux ,Windows>=10  	---> Use SSH
=> From Windows<10 		---> Use Putty
=> From Any OS 			---> Use EC2 Connect

1) Makesure  that You have the key-pair ( myapp-key-pair.pem )
2) Makesure that You have Security Group Configured Correctly.

a) Using SSH to Connect from Your Linux or Mac or  Windows>=10
===================================================
1) Goto Command Prompt and Be in the folder where .pem file is there.

F:\AWS\mykeypairs> 

2) Run the follwing command
F:\AWS\mykeypairs> ssh -i myapp-key-pair.pem ubuntu@44.204.77.46

3) If problem related to Permissions then Change the Permissions
	chmod 0400 myapp-key-pair.pem ( linux or Mac)
	Windows Style 

4) Now Run the follwing command
	ssh -i myapp-key-pair.pem ubuntu@44.204.77.46

b) Using Putty to Connect from Your Windows<10
================================
1) Download and INstall Putty
https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html
You will see Putty and Putty Gen

2) Convert pem file to .ppk file using Putty Gen tool

3) Open Putty 


c) Using EC2 Instance Connect to Connect from Any OS
==================================


d) Set Password to Cloud Servers
=========================
*** All the Cloud Servers are Password less by deafult.***
*** Password Authetication is disabled by deafult.***

Set Password
Enable Password Authentication

Setup Password for VM Instances
------------------------------------------------
1)Instance is Running
2)Connect with SSH with any method learnrd above

3)Goto Root User

sudo bash/ sudo -i / sudo su

4) Set the password for user - ubuntu
passwd ubuntu

5)Edit this file...  /etc/ssh/sshd_config

cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config

vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

PermitRootLogin yes

PasswordAuthentication yes

6)re-start the SSHD service

service ssh restart

ssh  ubuntu@44.204.77.46
======================
ssh ubuntu@44.204.77.46
