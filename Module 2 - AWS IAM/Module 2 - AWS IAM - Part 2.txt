3) Building Blocks of IAM
====================
IAM Users 
IAM Groups 
IAM Roles 

=========
4) IAM Users 
=========
=> User is a Physical Person
=> Create One User Account for One Physical User.

=> When you create the User first time then that user has no permissions
=> When you create the User first time with Password Reset Option then that user will have One permission called  IAMUserChangePassword

=> Dont Attach permissions to User Directly.

5) IAM Groups 
------------
=> Group is like Job Function 
=> Group contains Users
=> Group does not contain another Group.

=> Grant permissions to Group Directly.

============
6) IAM Roles 
============
=> Internal Usage within AWS
=> Role is Permission to Access One AWS Resource from Another  AWS Resource
=> Role for AWS Internal Resource , Not for User.

==============
7) Best Practices
=============
1) Allow Users to Inherit Permissions from Groups
----------------------------------------------------------------
=> Always Assign the Policies to Groups 
=> Dont Assign the Policies to Users directly

2) User and Person Best Practice
-----------------------------------------
One User = One Physical Person

=> Always work on the Principle One User equals to  One Physical Person.
=> Never share User Accounts accross multiple People.

3) Principle of Least Privilege
--------------------------------------
=> Only Assign the Minimum of Privileges to User what the User need to do the Job.

8) Identity Providers
=================
=> If you already manage user identities outside of AWS, you can use IAM Identity Providers instead of creating IAM users in your AWS account.

=> Identity Provider (IdP) gives these external user identities permissions to use AWS resources in your account. 

=> This is useful if your organization already has its own identity system like Active Directory. 

=>To use an IdP, you create an IAM identity provider entity to establish a trust relationship between your AWS account and the IdP. 

=> IAM supports IdPs that are compatible with the following two Plicies.
    1) SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion Markup Language )   - Active Directory
    2) OIDC  (OpenID Connect) 

=============================
9) IAM Audit Tools/IAM Security Tools
=============================
1)IAM Credential Report  
--------------------------------
=> Credential Report  is an Account Level Report
=> Credential Report Contains the List of Users and Status of User Credentials

2) IAM Access Advisor
-----------------------------
=> Access Advisor is User Level
=> Access Advisor shows the Permissions granted to User and When those Services are last accessed.
=> You can use this Information to revise the User Policies.
 
10) Account Settings
===============
=> Change Password Policy
