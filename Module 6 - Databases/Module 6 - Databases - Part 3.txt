Module 6 : Databases - Part 3
========================
1) Amazon RDS
2) Amazon Aurora
3) ElastiCache
4) DynamoDB
5) Exam Tips
Exam #6 - Databases


 ======================
3) RDS - Storage Auto-Scaling
 ======================
=> You can Increase the Sorage of RDS Instance Dynamically.
=> You can start with Minimum Storage -  say 20GB and set Maximum Storage Threshold (max be 65,535 GB)
=> Automatically Updates the Storage if free storage is less than 10% of Allocated Storage.
=> Useful for the Applications with Un-Predictable Workloads.
=> Supports EBS Storage only.

==============
4) RDS Backups
==============
=> Backups are automatcally enabled in RDS.
=> Backups are stored in Amazon S3.
=> Because of Automated Backups
  *** Daily full-backup of the Database will be taken during the maintainance window
  *** Backup the Transaction Logs for Every 5 Minutes
  *** Default backup retention period is 7 days ( can be increased to 35 days)
=> You can disable automated backups(Not Recommanded) and you can take the backups manually also.

 ==============
5) RDS Snapshots
==============
=> Snapshots are automatcally enabled in RDS.
=> You can creates a Snapshot of your DB instance manually. ***
=> Snapshots are stored in Amazon S3.
=> Manual snapshots are retained forever until you delete them.
=> You can create a new DB instance by restoring from a DB snapshot. 
=> You can replicate snapshots to a different AWS Region of your choice. 

=> You can copy automated snapshots or manual DB snapshots. 
=> You can make multiple copies of an automated snapshots or manual snapshot, but each copy must have a unique identifier.
=> You can copy a snapshot within the same Region 
=>You can also copy a snapshot across Regions with some limitations.

 ======================
6) RDS - Encryption
 ======================
a) Encryption in Transit
----------------------------------
=> Use SSL Certificates to Encrypt the RDS data in Transit

b) Encryption at Rest
-------------------------------
=> You can Encrypt Primary Database and Its Read-Replicas with KMS - AES 256 Encryption Alogorithm.
=> Encryption has to be defined at RDS Instance Creation time.
=> If the  Primary Database is Encrypted then all of its Read-Replicas will be Encrypted automatically.
=> If the  Primary Database is Not Encrypted then all of its Read-Replicas will Not be Encrypted.

=> Snapshots of Un-Encrypted  Database are Un-Encrypted.
=> Snapshots of Encrypted  Database are Encrypted.

Demo3:  How to Encrypt an Un-Encrypted RDS Databse?
-------------------------------------------------------------
a) Create the Snapshot of Un-Encrypted  Database
b) Copy the Snapshot and Enable the Encryption
c) Restore the Database from Encrypted  Snapshot 
d) Configure the applications to talk to New Encrypted  Database and Delete Old Un-Encrypted Database.
e) Create the Replicas from  Newly Encrypted  Database
f)  Configure the applications to talk to New Encrypted  Replicas and Delete Old Un-Encrypted Replicas 

 ===========================
7) RDS - From Single-AZ to Multi-AZ
 ===========================
=> You can move from Single-AZ to Multi-AZ
	** with Zero Downtime Operation
	** without Stoping the Database.
=> Just Click on Modify and Select Multi-AZ

Internally following things will happen
--------------------------------------------------
1) Take the Snapshot of Primary DB
2) Restore Standby DB from Snapshot 

===================
Multi-AZ DB Cluster - new
Creates a DB cluster with a primary DB instance and two readable standby DB instances, 
with each DB instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ)
