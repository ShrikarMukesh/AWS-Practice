11) Analytics -  Tips
========================


1) Amazon Redshift 
=================

=> Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the AWS Cloud. 
=> Redshift is a large Relational Database used in Big Data Applications.
=> Redshift is used for OLAP Applications, not for OLTP Applications
(OLAP  - Online Analytical Processing)
(OLTP  - Online Transaction Processing)- RDS ,Aurora, DynamoDD etc 

Key Points about Redshift
========================
a) Size:
---------
=> It can store upto 16PB per Cluster.

b) Relational:
------------------
=> Redshift is a Relational Database.
=> You can Integrate BI Tools like Amazon QuickSight or Tableau

c) Usage:
-----------
=> Redshift is a great tool for BI Applications.
=> It is not a replacement for Standard RDS Databases.

Snapshots and DR
===================
=> Redshift do not have Multi-AZ mode.
=> You can create Snapshots of your Redshift cluster

=> You can restore the Snapshot into new Cluster

=> There are two types of snapshots: 
a) Automated Snapshots 
b) Manual Snapshots 

a) Automated Snapshots:
--------------------------------
=> By default Redshift takes a snapshot about every eight hours or following every 5 GB per node of data changes, or whichever comes first. 
=> Automated snapshots are enabled by default when you create a cluster.

=> Automated snapshots are deleted at the end of a retention period. 
=> Default retention period is 1 day and you can modify up to max of 35 Days.

b) Manual Snapshots 
-----------------------------
=> You can take a manual snapshot any time. 
=> By default, manual snapshots are retained indefinitely, even after you delete your cluster. 
=> You can specify the retention period when you create a manual snapshot

Cross-Region:
------------------
=> You can configure Redshift to automatically copy snapshots of the Redshift Cluster to another Region

2) Amazon EMR
==============
*** EMR --- Elastic MapReduce

=> EMR is a Fully Managed Big Data platform that allows you to process massive amount of data using Open Source Tools like Hadoop, Spark, Hive etc.
