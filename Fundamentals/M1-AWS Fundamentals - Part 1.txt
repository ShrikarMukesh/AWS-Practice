Team of People 

***100 Capacity in Data Center
***Increase to 250 Capacity  - 1 Month
***Descrease to 100 Capacity

Problems
===========
1) Cost
2) Scaling 
3) More Team for Managing DC.  


2) Exploring Cloud Computing
======================
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking —over the Internet (“the cloud”) 

You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change.

Top benefits of cloud computing
------------------------------------------
1) Cost
2) Global scale
3) Performance
4) Security
5) Speed to Market
6) Reliability

3) Cloud Computing Service Models
===========================
There are 3 Cloud Computing Service Models
A) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
B) Platform as a Service (PaaS)
C) Software as a Service (SaaS)

1) DC Physical Space
2) Networking
3) Storage 
4) Servers
5) Operating Systems
6) Development Tools
7) Applications

A) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
----------------------------------------------
With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.

Ex:
AWS ,Azure , GCP etc

B) Platform as a Service (PaaS)
----------------------------------------------
=> PaaS refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering and managing software applications. 
=> PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network and databases needed for development.

Ex:
AWS ,Azure , GCP, Heroku, force.com etc

C) Software as a Service (SaaS)
----------------------------------------
=> SaaS is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. 
=> With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. 
=> Users connect to the application over the Internet, usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet or PC.

Ex: 
JLC LMS  , Zoom , Survey Monkey, mailChimp etc


4) Cloud Computing Deployment Models
=============================
=> Not all clouds are the same and not one type of cloud computing is right for everyone. 
=> Several different models have evolved to offer the right solution for your needs.

A) Public Cloud
B) Private Cloud
C) Hybrid Cloud

A) Public Cloud
-------------------
=> Public clouds are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service providers, which deliver their computing resources like Servers ,Storage and Databases etc over the Internet. 

Ex:
AWS , Azure , GCP , Alibaba , IBM , Oracle 

=> With a public cloud, all hardware, software and other supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider. You access these services and manage your account using a web browser.

B) Private Cloud
----------------------
=> Private Cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organisation. 
=> Private Cloud can be physically located on the company’s on-Premise Data Centers. or on third-party Data Centers.
=> In Private Cloud, the services and infrastructure are always maintained on a private network and the hardware and software are dedicated solely to One organisation.

Ex: AWS , Azure , HPE , VMware , Oracle , IBM / Red Hat OpenShift , Dell, Cisco


C) Hybrid Cloud
----------------------
=> Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them.

=> By allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds, a hybrid cloud gives your business greater flexibility, more deployment options and helps optimise your existing infrastructure, security and compliance.


5) Introduction to AWS
================
=> AWS is the No.1 Cloud Provider Now.
=> AWS  has 47% of Market share in 2019.(No.1)
=> Azure  has 22% of Market share in 2019. (No.2)
=> GCP  has 18% of Market share in 2019. (No.3)
 
=> AWS offers build and deploy applications with
*****High-Performence 
*****High-Availability 
*****Low-Latency 
*****Highly Scalable 
*****Highly Secured

6) AWS History
==========
In 2002 - Launched Internally
In 2006 - Launched Publicly - AWS began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses 

7) AWS Global Infrastructure
=====================
AWS Regions
Availability Zones
AWS Local Zones
AWS Edge Locations

8) AWS Regions and Availability Zones
-------------------------------------------------
Region is a physical location around the world where data centers present. 

Region is group of Availability Zones.

Each AWS Region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically separate AZs within a geographic area. 

An Availability Zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, 

AWS provides a more extensive global footprint to support its global footprint and ensure customers are served across the world

Each AWS Local Zone location is an extension of an AWS Region where you can run your latency sensitive applications using AWS services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon File Storage, and Amazon Elastic Load Balancing in geographic proximity to end-users. 

26 Launched Regions
8 Announced Regions

84 Availability Zones
17 Local Zones

245 Countries and Territories Served
