Exam #1 on AWS Fundamentals 


1) Sign-up with AWS
================
Hello Srinivas
hellosrinivas99@gmail.com
Phone No.
Card Details

https://aws.amazon.com/console/


2) Accessing AWS from AWS Console
=========================
Console Login for Root Account - Username and Password 

Username  : hellosrinivas99@gmail.com
Password  : sdjhsjhdjhs

3) Accessing AWS from CLI
=========================
To Access AWS Resources from CLI or  SDK, you need two things

1) Access Key ID
2) Secrect Access Key

=> Logon to AWS Console with AWS Root Account.

=> Create the IAM User with the name -  hello123

=> When you create User in AWS , You can give two types of Acesss.
A) Access to Management Console
B) Progrmatic Access

=> When User is Created , AWS assigns least permissions to that user.

=> You can assign the required permissions to that user.


=> When user wants to access the AWS with Management Console then user needs the Username and Passoword.

=> When user wants to access the AWS Progrmatically with Commandline or any other tools  then user needs Access key ID and Secret access key

Keep the following belongs to the User
==============================
User name : yashwant123
Password	 : Yashwant123
Access key ID	: AKIASNQUWN6SRPYEAATN
Secret access key	: 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
Console login link :  https://166473396133.signin.aws.amazon.com/console


How to Access AWS from Command Line
=================================
1) Download AWS CLI
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi

2) Install AWS CLI

D:\Amazon\AWSCLIV2

 aws.exe => 

3) Configure the AWS CLI 

aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIASNQUWN6SRPYEAATN
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: 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
Default region name [None]: us-east-2
Default output format [None]: json

4) Create IAM User as follows.

aws iam create-user --user-name hai12345

aws ec2 describe-regions

aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region ap-south-1

aws s3 ls


4) AWS CloudShell
=============
=> AWS CloudShell is a browser-based shell that makes it easy to securely manage and  interact with your AWS resources. 

=> CloudShell is pre-authenticated with your console credentials. Common development and operations tools are pre-installed, so no local installation or configuration is required. 

=> With CloudShell, you can quickly run scripts with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)

=> You can use CloudShell right from your browser and at no additional cost.

=> AWS CloudShell is available only in Limited Regions. Check your region.

===============
5) Key AWS Services
===============

25 Service Types provided by AWS on 4th-JUne-2022.

A) Compute 
   => EC2, Lambda, ElasticBeanstalk

B) Storage
   => S3, EBS, EFS, Fsx, Storage Gateways

C) Databases
   => RDS, DynamoDB, RedShift

D) Networking
   => VPC, Route 53, Direct Connect, API Gateways

6) Shared Responsibility Model
========================
=> Not all the things done by AWS.

AWS - Responsibility for Security OF the Cloud
----------------------------------------------------------
=> Hardware , Regions , Availabilit Zones , Edge Locations
=>Compute , Storage , DataBases , NetWorking

YOU - Responsibility for Security IN the Cloud
----------------------------------------------------------
=> Customer Data 
=> Platforms, Applications, IAM
=> OS Patches, Updates
=> Client Side Encryption
=> Server Side Encryption

Q) Can you do this in AWS Console?

=> if the Answer is Yes, You are likely Responsible

=> if the Answer is No, AWS is likely Responsible

7) Summary
========

=====================
1) Building Blocks of AWS
=====================
***  AWS Global Infrastructure
***  Regions
***  Availability Zones
***  Local Zones
***  Data Centers
***  Edge Locations

AWS Global Infrastructure
----------------------------------
=> 26 Regions and 8 Regions Announced
=> 84 Availability Zones and 17 Local Zones
=> 410 + Edge Locations/POP locations

Data Center:
----------------
=> Data Center is just a building filled with Servers with Redundant Power , Networking , Connectivity etc

Availability Zone
---------------------
=> One or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region
=> Group of 1 or more Data Centers called as Availability Zone

Local Zone
----------------
=> Local Zone is an extension of AWS Region  where you can run your Latency Sensitive Applications.

Region: 
-----------
=> Region is a Physical Location aroud the World where Data Centers present.
=> Region Consists of 2 or more  Availability Zones

Edge Locations/POP Location :
-------------------------------------------
=> Edge Locations are endpoints for AWS that are used for caching content.
=> This Includes CloudFront and Amazon CDN
