=======================
3) Encrypting EBS Volumes
=======================
=> EBS Encrypts your Data with Data Key using Industry-Standard AES-256 Algorithm
=> You aren't required to build, maintain, and secure your own key management infrastructure
=> EBS encryption uses AWS KMS keys when Encrpting the Volumes and Snapshots.
=> You can attach both encrypted and unencrypted volumes to an instance simultaneously.

What happens When you Encrypt the EBS Volumes:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
=> All Data at Rest will be Encrypted inside the Volume.
=> All Data in the Flight between the Instance and Volume will be Encrypted.
=> All the Snapshots created from Encrypted Volumes will be Encrypted automatically.
=> All the Volumes Created from Encrypted Snapshots  will be Encrypted automatically.

=>Encryption and Decryption are handled transperently. You noo need to do anything.
=>Encryption has minimal Impact on the Latency.
=> You can encrypt the Root device Volumes upon Creation.


Demo 1:

How to Encrypt the Existing Volumes
=============================
1) Create the Snapshot of Unencrypted root device volume
2) Create the Copy of the Snapshot and Select the Encryption option
3) Create the AMI from Encrypted Snapshot 
4) Use the AMI to Launch new Encrypted Instance.

Student Questions:
=================
Q1) Snapshot will be taken after X amount of time, what will happen to the data with in an interval of taking snapshot ?
SunDay:9P.M 
---> Friday Crashed
Next Sunday : 9P.M

Q2)  If i detached EBS and delete this, Then Snapshot will be delete at same time ?

Q3) will restore from latest snapshot or need to restore base plus incremental snapshot

Q4) whether we need to create or amazon will take care for new volume ?  You 

Q5) can we take snapshot of root volume aswell Yes Yes

Q6)  its mandatory to take S3 service for snapshot?? or we can take backup in our physical system?
S3
