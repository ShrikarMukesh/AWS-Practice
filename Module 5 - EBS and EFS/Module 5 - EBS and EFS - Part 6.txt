7) FSx Fundamentals
================
=> FSx- File System

FSx Overview:
============
=> Amazon FSx makes it easy and cost effective to launch, run, and scale feature-rich, high-performance file systems in the cloud. 

=> You can choose between four widely-used file systems: 
	a) FSx for Windows File Server
	b) FSx for Lustre
	c) FSx for NetApp ONTAP
	d) FSx for OpenZFS

=> This choice is typically based on your familiarity with a given file system or by matching the file system's feature sets, performance profiles, and data management capabilities to the requirements of your workload.

a) FSx for Windows File Server
========================
=> FSx for Windows File Server provides fully managed Microsoft Windows file servers, backed by a fully native Windows file system. 

=> FSx for Windows File Server has the features, performance, and compatibility to easily lift and shift enterprise applications to the AWS Cloud.

=> FSx has support for native Windows file system features and for the industry-standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol to access file storage over a network. 

=> With file storage on FSx, the code, applications, and tools that Windows developers and administrators use today can continue to work unchanged.

Use Cases:
----------
* Windows applications
* Home Directories
* Web Serving
*Content Management
*Data Analytics
etc

b) FSx for Lustre
==============
About Lustre File System:
----------------------------------
=> Lustre File System is an Open-Source File System designed for applications that require fast storageâ€”where you want your storage to keep up with your compute.

=> Lustre was built to solve the problem of quickly and cheaply processing the world's ever-growing datasets. 
=> It's a widely used file system designed for the fastest computers in the world. 

=> It provides sub-millisecond latencies, up to hundreds of GBps of throughput, and up to millions of IOPS.

FSx for Lustre:
----------------------
=>  FSx for Lustre is Fully Managed File System that is Optimized for High Compute-Intensive workloads.

=> As a fully managed service, Amazon FSx makes it easier for you to use Lustre for workloads where storage speed matters.

=> FSx for Lustre eliminates the traditional complexity of setting up and managing Lustre file systems, enabling you to spin up and run high-performance file system in minutes. 

=> FSx for Lustre is POSIX-compliant, so you can use your current Linux-based applications without having to make any changes. 

Use Cases:
----------
* High Performance Computing
* Artificial Intelligence
* Machine Learning
* Video Processing
* Financial Modeling
etc

===============
8) AWS Backup
===============
=> AWS Backup is a fully managed service centralizing and automating the backup of data for AWS services such as EC2, EBS, EFS, RDS, DynamoDb, S3 etc in the cloud, and on premises. 

=> Using AWS Backup, you can configure backup policies and monitor activity for your AWS resources in one centralized place. 

=> AWS Backup is an ideal solution for implementing standard backup plans for your AWS resources across your AWS accounts and Regions. 

=>  AWS Backup can be used with AWS Organizations to backup Multiple AWS Accounts in your Organization.

=> It gives Centralized Control access to All AWS Services in  Multiple AWS Accounts in your Organization.

Benefits of AWS Backup
===================
1) Control Management:
------------------------------
=> Use a Single. Control backup Console allowing you to centralize your backups accross Multiple AWS Services in  Multiple AWS Accounts in your Organization.
=> Auditing is made easy due to consolidated view of backups accross many AWS Services.

2) Automation:
--------------------
=> You can Create Automated Backup Schedules and Retention Policies.
=>You can also Create Lifecycle Policies allowing you to expire the Un-Necessory backups after perios of time.

3) Improved Compliance:
-----------------------------------
=> Backup Policies can be Enforced while backups can be Encrypted both at Rest and In Transit, Allowing alignment to regulatory compliance.
