Exam #5 - EBS and EFS

================
9) Exam Tips
================

1) EBS Volumes Fundamentals
=======================
=> EBS  - Elastic Block Storage
=> EBS Volume - Virtual Hard Disk in the Cloud.
=> EBS Volumes are Storage Volumes you can attach to Your EC2 Instances
=> Use these EBS Volumes the same way you use any system Hard Disk.
	* Run Operating System
	* Run Database
	* Create File System
	* Store Data
	* Install Applications
	

=> EBS Volumes will be in the Same AZ where EC2 Instance is present.
=>You can Resize the EBS Volumes on the Fly without ReStrating.
=> You can change the Volume Types on the Fly without ReStrating.

EBS Volume Types
==============
1) General Purpose SSD (gp2)
2) General Purpose SSD (gp3)

3) Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)
4) Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2)
**5) Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2 Block Express)

6) Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
7) Cold HDD (sc1)

IOPS Vs Throughput
================
IOPS
====
=> Measures the Number of Read and Write Operations per Second.
=> Important Metric for Low-Latency Applications and Transactional Workloads.
=> Ability to perform Read and Writes Very Quickly.
=> Choose Provisoned SSD (gp1,gp2,io1, io2, io2 Block Express)

Throughput
==========
=> Measures the Number of Bits Read or Written per Second (MB/S).
=> Important Metric for Large Data Sets, Complex Queries.
=> Ability to deal with Large Data Sets.
=> Choose Throughput Optimized HDD(st1) , For Low cost use Cold HDD(sc1)


2) Volumes and SnapShots
=====================
=> Volums exist on EBS where as Snapshots exists on S3.
=> Snapshots are point-in-time copies of Volumes and Incremental In nature.
=> First Snapshot will take some time to Create as there is not Previous point-in-time copy.
=> You can Share Snapshots between AWS Regions as well as AWS Accounts but First You need to Copy the Snapshot to target Region.

3) Encrypting EBS Volumes
=====================
=> EBS Encrypts your Data with Data Key using Industry-Standard AES-256 Algorithm
=> All Data at Rest will be Encrypted inside the Volume.
=> All Data in the Flight between the Instance and Volume will be Encrypted.
=> All the Snapshots created from Encrypted Volumes will be Encrypted automatically.
=> All the Volumes Created from Encrypted Snapshots  will be Encrypted automatically.
=>Encryption and Decryption are handled transperently. You noo need to do anything.

How to Encrypt the Existing Volumes
------------------------------------------------
a) Create the Snapshot of Unencrypted root device volume
b) Create the Copy of the Snapshot and Select the Encryption option
c) Create the AMI from Encrypted Snapshot 
d) Use the AMI to Launch new Encrypted Instance.

4) Instance Store Volumes
===================
=> Instance Store Volumes are called as Ephemeral/Temporary Storage.
=> This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. 

=> Instance Store-backed EC2 Instances can not be stopped.
       If the Underlying Host fails, You will lose your data in Instance Store.

=> EBS-backed EC2 Instances can be stopped.
      You will not lose the data on this Instance If you stop the Instance.

=> You can reboot both EBS-backed and Instance Store-Backed Instance and You will not lose your Data.

=> By Default, Both the Volumes will be deleted on Termination.
      However , You can tell to AWS to keep the EBS Root device Volume.


5) EC2 Hibernation
================
=> EC2 Hibernation saves the contents from the instance memory (RAM) to EBS root volume. 
=> Much faster to Bootup because do not need to re-load the O.S,Applications etc.
=> Instance RAM size Must be less than 150 GB.
=> Supported instance families
	Xen: C3, C4, I3, M3, M4, R3, R4, T2
	Nitro: C5, C5d, M5, M5a, M5ad, M5d, R5, R5a, R5ad, R5d, T3, T3a

=> Instances can not be Hibernated more than 60 Days.
=> Available for Windows, Amazon Linix and Ubuntu.
=> Available for On-Demand Instances and Reserved Instances.


6) EFS Fundamentals
=================
=> EFS is a Shared Storage that can be mounted on many EC2 Instances
=> Supports Network File System V4(NFSv4) protocal.
=> Only Pay for the Storage you use ( No Pre-Provisioning Required).
=> Can Scale Upto Peta Bytes

=> Can Support Thousands of Concurrent NFS Connections
=> Data is Stored accross multiple AZ's within given Region.
=> Read-After-Write Consistency.
=> EFS supports Encryption in transit and Encryption at rest

=> Supports the following Storage Tiers
a) EFS Standard
b) EFS Standard-IA
c) EFS One Zone 
d) EFS One Zone-IA

=> Supports EFS Lifecycle Management:



7) FSx Fundamentals
=================
a) Amazon FSx for Windows:
-----------------------------------------
=> When you need Centralized Storage for Windows based Applications such as Share Point, MicroSoft SQL Server, IIS Web Server or Any other native Microsoft Applications.

b) Amazon FSx for Lustre: 
-----------------------------------------
=> When you need High-Speed, High Capacity Storage.
=> Suitable for Applications that do High Performance Computing(HPC), BigData, A.I and ML
=> Remember that FSx for Lustre can Store Data Directly on S3 and Can Access Data from S3.

8) AWS Backup
============
a) Consolidation : 
-------------------------
Use AWS Backup to backup the data for AWS services such as EC2, EBS, EFS, RDS, DynamoDb, S3 etc in the cloud, and on premises. 

b) Oraganizations: 
--------------------------
You can use AWS Organizations with AWS Backup to backup  your Multiple AWS Services in  Multiple AWS Accounts in your Organization.

c)Benefits:
---------------
=> AWS Backup gives Centralized Control access letting you to Automate the Backups and define Lifecycle Policies for your Data.
=> You get better Compliance.
=> You can enforce the backup Policies.
