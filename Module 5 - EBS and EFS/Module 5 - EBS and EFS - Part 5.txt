Exam #5 - EBS and EFS


================
6) EFS Fundamentals
================
=> EFS - Elastic File System

EFS Overview:
============
=> EFS is a Managed Network File System (NFS) that can be mounted on many EC2 Instances.
=> EFS Works with EC2 Instances in Multiple AZ's i.e 
Data will be Stored accross Multiple AZ's within Region.

=> You can Create EFS file system, mount the file system on an EC2 instance, and then read and write data to and from your file system. 
=> You can mount an Amazon EFS file system in your virtual private cloud (VPC), through the Network File System versions 4.0 and 4.1 (NFSv4) protocol.

=> Highly Available and Scalable but More Expensive.

=> Supports the Network File System version 4 (NFSv4.1 and NFSv4.0) protocol, 
=>  Multiple compute instances, including EC2, ECS, and AWS Lambda, can access an EFS at the same time
=> Compatible with Linix-bases AMI's ( Not Supported for Windows AMI's currently).
=> File System Scales automatically, No Capacity Planing is required
=> Only Pay for storage you use


EFS Performance
============
=> EFS supports thousands of Concurrent Connections with EC2 Instances.
=> EFS can Handle upto 10Gbps in throughput
=> EFS Storage can be scaled to Peta Bytes.

EFS Encryption:
=============
=> EFS supports Encryption in transit and Encryption at rest.
=> You can enable encryption at rest when creating an Amazon EFS file system. 
If you do, all your data and metadata is encrypted. 
=> You can enable encryption in transit when you mount the file system. 


Storage Tiers
==========
=> EFS comes with Storage Tiers and Lifecycle Management which allows to move the data from One tier to another tier after N-days.

=> EFS supports following Storage Tiers

a) EFS Standard
----------------------
=>  Stores Data in Multiple AZ's
=> For Frequestly Accessed Files

b) EFS Standard-IA
---------------------------
=> Stores Data in Multiple AZ's
=> For Infrequestly Accessed Files

c) EFS One Zone 
--------------------------
=> Stores Data in Single AZ's
=> For Frequestly Accessed Files

d) EFS One Zone-IA
-----------------------------
=> Stores Data in Single AZ's
=> For Infrequestly Accessed Files


EFS Lifecycle Management:
====================
=> EFS Lifecycle Management automatically manages cost-effective file storage for your file systems. 

=> When enabled, Lifecycle Management migrates files that haven't been accessed for a set period of time to an infrequent access storage class

=>  You define that period of time by using a lifecycle policy.
EFS Standard => EFS Standard-IA
EFS One Zone  => EFS One Zone-IA

EFS Intelligent‐Tiering:
==================
=> EFS Intelligent‐Tiering uses lifecycle management to monitor the access patterns of your workload and automatically transitions files to and from your corresponding storage class.

=> With intelligent tiering, files in the EFS Standard or EFS One Zone that are not accessed for a period of time, for example 30 days, are transitioned to the corresponding EFS Standard-IA or EFS One Zone-IA  storage class. 

=> If access patterns change, EFS Intelligent‐Tiering automatically moves files back to the EFS Standard or EFS One Zone storage classes from EFS Standard-IA or EFS One Zone-IA  storage classes


EFS replication:
===========
=> You can create a replica of your Amazon EFS file system in the AWS Region of your preference using Amazon EFS Replication.

=> When enabled, Amazon EFS Replication automatically and transparently replicates the data and metadata on your EFS file system to a new destination EFS file system that is created in an AWS Region that you choose.

=> Amazon EFS automatically keeps the source and destination file systems synchronized.


EFS Use Cases:
===========
a) Content Management :
----------------------------------
=> Great Fit for Content Management Systems as you easily Share content among multiple EC2 Instances 

b) Web Servers
----------------------
=> Great Fit for Web Servers
=> Have Just Single Folder Structure for your website and Let multiple EC2 Instances to Access.
