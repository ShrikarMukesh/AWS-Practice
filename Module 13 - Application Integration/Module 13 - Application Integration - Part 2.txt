2.3) SQS Configurations( Cont...)
==========================
1) Visibility timeout:
---------------------------
=> Default Visibility timeout : 30 Seconds
=> You can set between 0 sec to 12 hours.

=> When backend server retrives and Process the message from Queue, that message stays in the Queue.
=> SQS does not purge the Message automatically becasue there is a chance that backend server has failed to process the message successfully due to any reason.

=> Therefore backend server must delete the message from Queue after reading and processing successfully.
=> So After Reading the Message, It stays in the Queue. 

=> To Avoid another backend server from processing the Same Queue again, SQS puts the Visibility timeout during which SQS stops other servers from reading and processing the Same message.

Ex: You Visibility timeout : 60 Seconds
=> When One Server reads the Message then SQS places the Lock on the Message for 60 seconds, but No one else can see that.
=> If the Server process the message in 60 seconds  and deletes that message then It is Over.
=> If the Server fails to process the message in 60 seconds then that message will show-up again in the Queue.
=> Now Any one can see that. Any One can Poll for that Message.

2) Message retention period:
-------------------------------------
=> Default Retention Peroid is 	4 Days
=> You can set Default Retention between 4 min to 14 days.

=> Messages have limited time to stay in the SQS Queue
=> If the Retension period is over , then SQS purge the messages automatically.

3) Delivery delay:
-----------------------
=> Default Delivery delay is 0 seconds.
=> You can set Upto 15 minutes.

=> When you specify the Delivery delay more than zero , SQS hides the message for set duration of time before it shows to backend server when backend server polls for the message.

4) Maximum message size:
----------------------------------
=> You can publish the message upto 256 KB of text in any format.

5) Receive message wait time:
---------------------------------------
=> Default Receive Message Wait time is 0 seconds which for Short Polling.
=> You can set wait time more than 0 seconds if you want Long Polling.
=> You can set max wait time of 20 Seecs

6) Encryption:
-------------------
=> Messages are encrypted in transit by default. 
=> You can enable at-rest encryption to your queue
=> You can add Client-Sid Encryption if you want.

7) Queue Depth:
--------------------
=> This can be a trigger for Auto Scaling
=> You can Integrate SQS and CloudWacth to fire the Alaram based on Queue Depth Metric to Scale the Servers.

8) Long Polling Vs Short Polling
------------------------------------------
=> Amazon SQS provides two ways to receive messages from a queue.
a) Short Polling 
b) Long Polling  

By default, SQS queues use short polling.

a) Short Polling:
----------------------
=> Backend server connects and check if there is any message on the queue. 
=> If the non-message is found, the backend server disconnects 
=> It keeps doing that until it finds messages to process

=> Short polling approach has some Problems. 
a)It burns CPU cycles on the backend server. 
b)We have to pay for making those extra API calls to SQS.

b) Long Polling  
----------------------
=> Long polling enables us to connect and then wait for a while. 
=> The highest long polling wait time is 20 seconds.

=> You can Set a value greater than zero for the parameter Receive message wait time


2.4) Dead-Letter Queues(DLQ)
========================
Q) What Happens when there is a problem in Message?
Ans: Backend Server fails to process the Message.

Q) What Happens when Message is not processed ?
Ans: It will pop-up again and again in Queue until its retention peroid(14Days) is over.
After retenstion peroid is over, That will be deleted automatically.

Q) What I have to do if dont want to show-up many times for longer peroid.
Ans: Once It reaches No. of Re-tries specified, that problamatic Message should be sidelined.

Retry Number - 10 Times

Q) What to do to sideline the problamatic Message?
Ans: Use Dead-Letter Queue 

About Dead-Letter Queue:
----------------------------------
=> Dead-Letter Queue is a queue that one or more source queues can use for messages that are not consumed successfully

=> SQS does not create the dead-letter queue automatically. 
=> You must first create the queue before using it as a dead-letter queue.

=> Dead-Letter Queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue. 
=> Similarly, Dead-Letter Queue of a standard queue must also be a standard queue.

where as
NO Message Duplication in FIFO Queue
