Exam #6 - Databases

=======================
2) Amazon Aurora - ( Contin..)
=======================

f) Push-Button Compute Scaling
---------------------------------------------
=> You can scale provisioned instances up or down. 
=>  You can scale the Compute Resources upto 
	** 96 vCPUs and 768 GB of RAM. ( r5 Classes)
	** 64 vCPUs and 1024 GB of RAM. (X2g Classes)
=> Compute scaling operations typically complete in a few minutes.


g) Fault-Tolerant and Self-Healing Storage
------------------------------------------------------------
=> 2 Copies of Your Data is contained in each AZ , with minimum of 3 AZ's  -- So 6 Copies of your data will be aiailable.

=> Aurora storage is transparently handling the loss of up to two copies of data without affecting database write availability and up to three copies without affecting read availability. 

=> Aurora storage is also self-healing; data blocks and disks are continuously scanned for errors and replaced automatically.


h) Automatic, Continuous, Incremental Backups and Point-in-Time Restore
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=> Aurora's backup capability enables point-in-time recovery for your instance. 

=> This allows you to restore your database to any second during your retention period, up to the last five minutes. 
=> Your automatic backup retention period can be configured up to thirty-five days. 

=> Automated backups are stored in  S3 which is designed for 99.999999999% durability. 

=> Aurora backups are automatic, incremental, and continuous and have no impact on database performance.

i) Snapshots
---------------
=> You can creates a Snapshot of your Aurora DB manually. 
=> Snapshots are stored in Amazon S3.
=> Manual snapshots are retained forever until you delete them.
=> You can create a new DB instance by restoring from a DB snapshot. 
=> You can copy snapshots 

j) Encryption
-----------------
a) Encryption in Transit
----------------------------------
=> Aurora Uses SSL (AES-256)  Certificates to Encrypt the data in Transit

b) Encryption at Rest
-------------------------------
=> You can Encrypt Aurora Database and Its Read-Replicas with KMS - AES 256 Encryption Alogorithm.
=> Encryption has to be defined at Aurora Database Instance Creation time.
=> If the  Aurora Master Database is Encrypted then 
	*** all of its automated backups will be Encrypted automatically.
	*** all of its snapshots will be Encrypted automatically.
	*** all of its replicas  will be Encrypted automatically.


k) Backtrack for Aurora MySQL
------------------------------------------
=> Backtrack allows you to move a database to a prior point in time without restoring data from a backup. 

=> This lets you quickly recover from user errors, such as dropping the wrong table or deleting the wrong row. 
=> Backtrack completes in seconds, even for large databases, because no data records need to be copied. 
=> You can go backwards and forwards to find the point just before the error occurred.

=> When you enable Backtrack, Aurora will retain data records for the specified Backtrack duration. 
Ex:
=> you could set up Backtrack to allow you to move your database up to 72 hours back. 


=================
Aurora Multi-Master
=================
=> In a multi-master cluster, all DB instances can perform write operations. 

=> The notions of a single read/write primary instance and multiple read-only Aurora Replicas don't apply. 

=> There isn't any failover when a writer DB instance becomes unavailable, because another writer DB instance is immediately available to take over the work of the failed instance.

====================
Aurora Global Database
====================
a) Aurora Cross-Region Read Replicas
b) Aurora Global Database
	=> One Primary Region for Read-Write
	=> Upto 5 Secondary Regions for Read-Only
	=> Upto 16 Read Replicas per Secondary Region

c) Helps for Decreasing Latency
d) Helps for DR.


==============
Aurora Serverless
==============
=> Aurora Serverless  is an on-demand autoscaling configuration for Aurora database. 

=> Aurora Serverless DB cluster is a DB cluster that scales compute capacity up and down based on your application's needs. 

=> Aurora Serverless provides a relatively simple, cost-effective option for infrequent, intermittent, or unpredictable workloads. 

=> It is cost-effective because it automatically starts up, scales compute capacity to match your application's usage, and shuts down when it's not in use.

=====================
Aurora Machine Learning
=====================
=> Aurora supports Machine Learning
=> Enables to add ML-based Predctions to Your applications via SQL
=> Provides Simple and Optimized Integration between Aurora and AWS ML-based Services.
=> Supported AWS ML-based Services
	a) Amazon SageMaker 
	b) Amazon Comprehed
